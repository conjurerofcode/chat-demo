We\u2019ll highlight the pros and cons of each method, how they work, and more.In total, there are six main body composition analysis methods, including Spren. These are as follows:SprenDexa ScanSkinfold TestUnderwater WeighingBod PodBIA ScaleWe\u2019ve provided you with an accuracy comparison table below\u2014it includes key measurements for each method, alongside the average cost of a scan.SprenHow it works: Spren uses your smartphone camera, machine learning algorithms, and computer vision to provide you with accurate and reliable body composition analysis results.It\u2019s as simple as snapping a pic, waiting for your results, and tracking your progress.Spren automatically generates numerous key biomarkers to help you monitor your health, going beyond the scale and showing you an accurate body composition analysis.ProsEasy to do: snap a full-body selfie and let Spren go to work.Laboratory accuracy from the comfort of your home: gain valuable insights without invasive testing procedures.View fat distribution: measure fat distribution to reach your long-term goals.ConsDoes not measure bone density: Dexa Scans are typically the best option for bone density analysis.Dexa ScanHow it works: A Dexa Scan, also known as dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, uses x-rays to calculate the distribution of lean muscle mass, fat mass, bone, and water in the body. During the scan, two x-ray beams\u2014of which are very safe\u2014pass through bodily tissues. The varying energy absorption allows practitioners to measure body composition, including fat distribution, accurately.And as already mentioned, it\u2019s often considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d body composition analysis tool, adopted by many healthcare professionals and commonly used in a clinical setting [8].ProsMeasures bone density: no other method calculates bone density\u2014this is ideal for revealing osteoporosis and other bone-related conditions and perhaps even risk factors.Very accurate analysis method: one of the best methods for accurate body composition results, also showing fat distribution.ConsCan be very expensive: scans can cost upwards of $150.You are exposed to radiation: although only in small doses, some people can be sensitive to the exposure. You will experience a similar amount of radiation on a short flight.Not convenient: most people are unlikely to book regular Dexa Scans.Skinfold TestHow it works: A pair of skinfold calipers are used to measure the thickness (mm) of the skin at various sites on the body, including the abdominal, thighs, triceps, and chest).The skinfold test has been around for decades, and although it\u2019s relatively easy to do, results can be inaccurate and present several downsides. For example, the test relies on two predictions to provide results, reducing validity [10].We cover more of the downsides, alongside a few benefits below.ProsWidely used method: commonly used to accurately measure fat distribution.Good for measuring changes in fatness in children: skinfolds have limited utility for overweight and severely obese adults [2].ConsInvasive: some people may find the skinfold test invasive and uncomfortable.Uses two predictions to calculate results: this creates room for error and may produce inconsistent and unreliable results.Must be done by a professional: lots of room for error (e.g., measuring the wrong site), so it must be done by a professional for accurate results.Underwater WeighingHow it works: The participant sits down on a scale while submerged in a tank of water. It\u2019s important to exhale fully to reduce error and ensure accurate results. The test is usually repeated three times for reliability.Underwater weighing relies on the Archimedes principle\u2014which states that when your body is completely submerged, the volume of fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the body [5].You are also weighed before completing the test. Test administrators use these measurements to calculate body fat percentage. Moreover, because muscle tissue is denser than fat tissue, if your underwater weight is heavy, this indicates a lower body fat percentage.According to research, underwater weighing is one of, if not the most valid technique for the assessment of body fat and lean tissue in a clinical setting\u2014aside from post-mortem analysis [3]. But it does have a few downsides. For example, underwater weighing is uncomfortable, not convenient, and does not measure two key metrics: fat distribution and bone density.ProsAccurately measures body volume: the Archimedes principle is an accurate method of analysis.ConsYou must be submerged underwater: many people find this uncomfortable or even terrifying.Must be done in a laboratory with a trained specialist: this is not a convenient or accessible option, often leading to irregular check-ins.Sources of error: if the participant does not exhale fully during the test, the body fat readings will be inaccurate.Bod PodHow it works: the participant enters an enclosed pod where body volume is measured via air displacement plethysmography. This accurately calculates body density.The Bod Pod has become more popular in recent years, but the results are not as extensive or impressive compared to other methods, such as underwater weighing and Dexa Scans [9].ProsAccurately measures body volume: air displacement accurately measures body volume.ConsBad for claustrophobic people: confined spaces make this a poor option for those who do not like small or tight spaces.Expensive to purchase the equipment: it costs upwards of $50,000 to purchase a Bod Pod.BIA ScaleHow it works: small electrical currents are sent through the body to measure body composition. All bodily tissues, including muscle and fat, differ in electrical conductivity\u2014this is because the water content varies.BIA, known as bioimpedance analysis, is non-invasive, low cost, and is currently one of the more popular body composition analysis methods that you can do yourself at home [6]. Although, it does have its limitations\u2014more on these below.ProsNon-invasive: can be done at home, with no professional help.Easy to do and highly repeatable: you can perform routine scans for accurate body composition analysis over a set period.ConsNot the most accurate method for severely obese people: assumes the hydration factor of the fat-free mass is constant and is not different in the obese population. Also, body geometry and water distribution are likely to differ [1].Inadequate hydration may report incorrect results: fat-free mass and bone density may be underestimated if dehydrated.Does not measure fat distribution: BIA measures total fat but cannot report accurate fat distribution (e.g., android and gynoid fat).Measuring tapeWe have a bonus method for you\u2014one that you can do at home\u2014but it does not provide the most accurate results. The measuring tape method is best paired with another measurement for increased reliability.That\u2019s right: you can use a tape measure and a handy equation to calculate an estimated body fat percentage.How it works: take measurements around your hips, waist, and neck. An equation is used to estimate total body volume and subsequent body fat percentage.ProsLow cost: the most cost-effective body composition method, but the results are the least accurate and may contain a human error.Highly convenient: you can do this yourself from the comfort of your own home in privacy.ConsSome people may find this method stressful: you may be unsure where to measure on the body for accurate and repeatable results."}, {"Title": "How often should I scan myself?", "Source": "https://help.spren.com/article/552-how-often-should-i-scan-myself", "Content": "How often should I scan myself?There\u2019s no set rule for when to scan, but we recommend doing a body composition scan every 1 - 2 weeks if you are on a weight loss journey or actively trying to change your body composition.We do not recommend scanning more than once per week, because it can take at least that long for your physiology to show meaningful changes.Consistency is very important \u2014 take repeat scans at the same time of day and place, with similar lighting and clothing for more comparable results."}, {"Title": "What are the optimal scan conditions?", "Source": "https://help.spren.com/article/615-what-are-the-optimal-scan-conditions", "Content": "What are the optimal scan conditions?We recommend keeping all conditions (lighting, time of day, environment, clothes, etc.) the same each time you scan.

Because BMI does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual, further assessment using more comprehensive metrics is needed to diagnose true health risks.Limitations of BMIBMI has many limitations. It is a poor tracking tool for weight change because there is no way to identify if changes in your weight are in fat or muscle.Because BMI does not distinguish fat mass from lean mass, it may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build.

The so-called \"fat-soluble\" vitamins\u2014A, D, E, and K\u2014are stored in the liver and in fatty tissues.Different types of body fat also regulate the temperatures of your individual organs as well as overall body.Too much body fat can lead to risks like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems but if your body fat drops too low, it can also have health consequences, just as when your body fat is too high.There are two types of fat in your body.Non-fat mass -also known as essential fat. Non-fat mass is found in your bones, liver, kidneys, intestines, and muscles. Fat in these places is required for your body to function normally.Fat mass- also known as stored fat is located in your adipose tissue. Fat mass is sued as energy for your body. It insulates and cushions your body. It surrounds your organs and is just under your skin.Women naturally have a higher body fat mass than men, and their body fat will also naturally increase as they age."}, {"Title": "Types of Body Fat", "Source": "https://help.spren.com/article/589-types-of-body-fat", "Content": "Types of Body FatEach type of body fat is not the same. They differ based on their function and location in your body, and are labeled by \"colors\" (but not actually colors).According to the Harvard School of Public Health, our fat cells can grow in size and number. The amount of fat cells in our bodies is determined soon after birth and during adolescence and tends to be stable throughout adulthood if weight remains somewhat stable. Eating too many calories in the long term can cause fat cells to increase in size and get stored in various areas throughout the body, which leads to a risk of chronic inflammation and glitches in a healthy metabolism, with the potential for new fat cells to grow.These larger fat cells become resistant to insulin, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can reduce the size of fat cells but not the number.Colors of FatWhiteMost fat cells in your body are white fat. They soak up dietary fat and store it for future energy needs. White fat cells can continue to grow larger. If you eat too much dietary fat, they will keep getting bigger \u2013 potentially to the point of dysfunction.BrownBrown fat cells interact with white fat cells to burn energy in cold weather and create heat. Lean people have more brown fat than non-lean people.\u00a0Brown fat is now thought to be more like muscle than like white fat. When activated, brown fat burns energy from white fat.BeigeBeige fat cells are also mixed in with white fat. We have more beige fat than brown fat. Beige fat cells are inactive until you get cold. Then they start burning energy like brown fat cells, just not as well. The research is learning more every year about the role of beige fat.EssentialEssential fat may consist of brown, white, or beige fat and is vital for the body to function normally. It is found in most organs, muscles, and the central nervous system including the brain. It helps to regulate hormones like estrogen, insulin, cortisol, and leptin; control body temperature; and assist in the absorption of vitamins and minerals. When a person\u2019s body fat dips below a certain level (about less than 5% in men and less than 10% in women), there may not be enough essential fat to perform these functions.LocationVisceralThis type of white fat is sometimes referred to as \u201cbelly fat\u201d or \u201ccentral obesity,\u201d as it accumulates deep in the abdominal cavity, wrapping around digestive organs like the pancreas, intestines, and liver but also the heart. Having excess visceral fat is linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.SubcutaneousYou can pinch this layer of fat that sits directly underneath the skin\u2019s surface, cushioning the bones and joints. It\u2019s the body\u2019s most abundant type of fat and tends to accumulate around the waist, hips, upper back, buttocks, and thighs. Very high amounts of subcutaneous fat can increase the risk of disease, though not as significantly as visceral fat.IntramuscularIntramuscular fat is generally considered to be any fat (including the fat between muscle groups and within a muscle) found beneath the fascia of a muscle and is the widest definition for fat beneath the fascia of a muscle.

Adults affected by normal weight obesity have a four-fold risk of cardiac and metabolic diseases (Correa-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2020).How does this happen?According to NASM (the National Academy of Sports Medicine), the same lifestyle choices that lead to obesity can lead to normal-weight obesity. This is including but is not limited to poor dietary choices (higher than ideal consumption of fats and carbohydrates coupled with low protein intake), poor sleep, high stress, and lack of exercise. It is important to highlight the role of lack of exercise, especially resistance training when examining the cause of normal-weight obesity as low skeletal muscle mass can be a driver in developing NWO.

Also, the rate that someone loses body fat over time can change.When starting a new weight loss journey, sometimes body fat percentage will not change significantly while the actual fat in your body is decreasing. This is because it is common to also lose muscle mass when losing weight. Over time, your body fat percentage can change more drastically as muscle mass loss slows while body fat loss continues, especially if weight loss dieting is paired with exercise. Because of this, it is helpful to monitor your fat mass and lean mass values alongside your body fat percentage values so you can have the full picture of your progress.What is a typical muscle mass gain?Most people doing targeted strength training supported by proper nutrition can expect to gain between 0.5 - 2 lbs (0.23 - 0.9 kg) of lean muscle mass in a month.Potential muscle mass gains will vary depending on several factors:Training Age: How long you\u2019ve been training.Hormonal Profile: The amount of testosterone and other hormones affect muscle production. They in turn are impacted by sleep, stress, recovery, medications, and other factors.Genetics: Genetics can affect your maximum muscle potential.Muscle Memory: Restoring previously lost muscle will happen faster than building new muscle.Nutritional Support: Proper nutrition and hydration are important for aiding muscle growth.Tracking lean body mass over time is a great way to see gains in muscle mass associated with your training. Because skeletal muscle mass is the largest component of lean mass in adults (40% of body weight) and bones, organs, and water weight change very little in adults over time, relative changes in lean mass are usually related to muscle mass.Consistent scans are crucial for comparable resultsWhen tracking progress over time, you should ideally scan at the same time of day and with similar clothing and lighting. This ensures that any changes in the results you're seeing are due to changes in your body composition and not other environmental or contextual changes (e.g. water weight, lighting, baggy clothing, etc.)."}, {"Title": "What factors affect Resting Metabolic Rate?", "Source": "https://help.spren.com/article/607-what-factors-affect-rmr", "Content": "What factors affect Resting Metabolic Rate?Many factors affect your resting metabolic rate; some you can control while others you can't.Some factors you can't control:AgeResting metabolic rate naturally decreases with age at approximately 2% per decade after peak growth.GeneticsScientists have identified many genes that are related to obesity that can affect resting metabolic rate.

If you want to lose weight and fat, you need to consume less than your TDEE.How much less should I eat?Most experts agree that\u00a0reducing calories by about 10 - 20% from your TDEE is\u00a0optimal and safe. Reducing by more than 20% can lead to muscle loss and other negative outcomes.What you eat mattersWhile your total caloric intake is important for weight loss, what you eat and the nutritional content of those calories are also very important for body composition (e.g. fat loss and maintaining muscle). Pay attention to macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat) and eat enough micronutrients for your body composition goals, to sustain the weight loss progress.Cutting sugar and non-nutritious foods and maintaining adequate protein and healthy fats are very important when trying to lose fat while maintaining muscle.Importance of exercise for fat lossYou can achieve weight loss with diet alone but if you want to reduce fat mass, maintain muscle mass, and in turn, more effectively decrease your body fat percentage, you need to eat better AND exercise appropriately.The types of exercise you do can also impacts how your body burns calories. While cardio exercise can directly target fat loss, resistance training helps build or maintain muscle that burns calories throughout the day when you are not working out. This is because muscle is calorie-burning and increasing your lean mass can actually increase your base metabolism.Remember to factor in your exercise program into your TDEE so you are matching your caloric needs appropriately.Remember other lifestyle factorsOther lifestyle factors such as poor sleep quality and high stress levels can negatively affect fat loss because they create a hormonal environment that requires you to store more energy to support holistic body function.To efficiently lose fat, especially if you have plateaued, addressing sleep and stress is important.We also recommend working with an experienced coach to help determine your macronutrient needs and appropriate exercise program to achieve your body goals."}, {"Title": "How to Use RMR to Build Muscle", "Source": "https://help.spren.com/article/600-how-to-use-rmr-to-build-muscle", "Content": "How to Use RMR to Build MuscleTo determine a daily caloric intake target to build muscle, you need to consider your resting metabolic rate (RMR) as well as yourdaily caloric burnfrom your normal activity level.To do this, you need to calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) using your RMR.Determining your Total Daily Energy ExpenditureYour TDEE is an estimation of how many calories you burn each day,includingphysical activity.

If you want to build muscle, you need to consume more calories than your TDEE while doing adequate muscle-building exercises.How much should I eat to build muscle?A good target for lean muscle gain is to consume about 110% to 120% of your TDEE (i.e. an extra 10% - 20%).This daily caloric increase is enough to gain muscle without excess calories that could cause fat gain as well. If you are trying to gain more muscle quicker, then aiming to consume more calories within that range will be better (when coupled with appropriate resistance training). However, there is a limit to muscle growth rate, which means going over that energy requirement will lead to the excess energy being stored as fat instead. Your hormonal profile affects this muscle growth limit as well.We recommend trying a daily calorie target for a few weeks while tracking progress. If you aren\u2019t seeing results, then adjust your calories up.What you eat mattersWhile your total caloric intake is important for weight gain, what you eat and the nutritional contents of those calories are also very important for body composition. Paying attention to macronutrients (i.e. protein, carbs, and fat) and eating enough micronutrients will provide the needed resources to build muscle. They will also help improve recovery, sleep, inflammation, and countless other areas of your well-being that indirectly help you build and maintain muscle.To build muscle, you need to focus on eating adequate protein (the building blocks of muscle). The American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, American College of Sports Medicine, and the International Association of Athletics Federations have all stated that aminimum of 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weightis sufficient for gaining muscle or losing fat.To support building lean muscle tissue and minimizing fat gain, many experts recommend following these guidelines for macronutrients consumption:Protein: 1 gram per pound of body weight; from healthy sourcesFat: At least 0.3 grams per pound of body weight, depending on total calories; from healthy sourcesCarbs: The remainder of calories; from healthy sources full of micronutrientsImportance of exercise for building muscleDoing strength and resistance training is key to building muscle.
